# Go Backend with Gin and MySQL

This is a basic example of a Go backend using the Gin framework and MySQL database with GORM.

- Go, often referred to as Golang, is a programming language developed by Google. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming.
- Gin is a web framework written in Go. It's lightweight and fast, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs in the Go programming language.
- Gorm is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Go. It provides a convenient way to interact with databases by mapping Go structs to database tables, making database operations more straightforward and idiomatic.
- MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is widely used for managing structured data and is compatible with various programming languages, including Go.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
- MySQL: [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

2. Set up your MySQL database:

Create a new database (e.g., your_database_name).

3. Configure your environment:

Create a .env file in the project root:

    PORT=8080
    DB_STRING=username:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/your_database_name?  charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local

Replace username, password, and your_database_name with your MySQL credentials.

4. Run the server:
   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

The server will start on http://localhost:8080.
